The Duck's name is Chick to be honest. I stole it from my sister on my 18th birthday. I say stole because I think that's what it was. It was a summer because my birthday is in June, and I was bored because it was the school break. So I barged into my sister's room like any self-righteous older sister, "Where's my birthday present?" 

And she was holding the Duck. She looked at the Duck, whom from henceforth would be called Chick. Or Duck. Ionno. And she handed me the ChickDuck. "Happy Birthday," she told me. 

Overall this blog is about me. And who I am. And what I do. And things. 

## What should you expect from this blog: 

I've thought long and hard about this. Because I've started at least 8 blogs in the past and none really stuck around, and I didn't want this to be the same. But it might. But at least I wanted to give it one more serious go at it. 

The topics I tend to focus on are: 

* things I've read and watched 
* coding
* fashion and beauty
* travelling 
* creative writing
