Today was the day I discovered Eileen Fisher. It might be a monumental thing. It might not be. But I do like what I see. What I see are 4 awesome kick-ass looking shoes, [the Coax Bootie][Coax link], [the Catch Mid Heel Sandal][Catch sandal link], [the Key Bootie][key link], and [the Vim Bootie][vim link].

I love all of their styles. There's something extremely sensual about the curve of the boots' and sandals' heels. Especially the 3in heels on the Vim and the Coax. I've got a mixed feeling about the Vim because I love its name, vim -- also, the name of the text editor that I've been liking lately and am currently using to type this entry now -- but I've also read in the reviews that they are a bit loud and uncomfortable. Meh. The Coax has the same appeal to me as the Vim; the nice curvy and chunky heel that I love, but in a more modern, sassy way, whereas Vim was more rustic. The 1in heel Key and Catch Sandals have that tiny darling pebble of a heel that I love. I love the cut out designs for Catch Me (very summary and chic) and I just find the Key Bootie's design very simplistic and easy to wear. So yeah. I like 'em all. Too bad that I can't "catch 'em all." [^1]

[^1]: Just wanted to put a bit of disclaimer that I love to obsess over things and write about them, but I rarely ever make the jump to actually purchase them so yeah. My shoe collection -- or any collection for that matter -- remains decently small; just the way I like it.

Aside from their shoe collection though, I like their [slouchy pants][slouchy pants link] and their [leather pants][leather pants link]. Let's be honest here. Leather pants is definitely not the look I'm going for and I'm only interested in it because of the discounted price. The slouchy pants, well, I want it for good reasons because there are times when I just want to wear something comfy out. But, if I'm thinking that I can get away wearing it to work, I'm probably kidding myself. So I should cross them both off for being impractical. God, I love the slouchy pants though. I mean, *think of the comfiness.* Okay, half crossed off. Let's just draw the line half way through *slou-*. Sigh, yeah, I mean no. Yeah. Gotta keep my head in the game. I promised myself that I'll wear my Madewell jeans solely for awhile before I even let my eyes wander. Can't cheat on my Madewell. 

Now [here][already pretty link] is one blogger's review of Eileen Fisher. But what really got me thinking about her was [this blog entry][gretchen link] by Grechen's Closet. I love [Grechen's Closet][gretchen home link]. I really love blogs that have awesome text. And text that are more descriptive and story-telling-y rather than just listing of products. (I also love [franish][franish link] because of this reason). 

But along the way, I stumbled upon [an article][slate link], in which Eileen Fisher talks about her leadership style as being "feminine." In the article, she says, "Men and women talk differently. I don't understand it exactly. Men talk faster. There's more like a debate style. I felt I wouldn't think fast enough." She went on to explain how she focuses more on nurturing her employees and being economically aware -- a very "feminine" business style. This made me pause, because I'm not too forthcoming with my opinions or aggressive either, but I pin it to be because I'm introverted rather than it be because of my biological sex. So, in the end, I agree with the writer of the article [Jessica Grose][jg link] when she stated the following in her article: 

> But the problem with saying that treating your workers well and caring about their happiness are “feminine” leadership traits, while debate and quick thinking are “masculine,” just doubles down on pre-existing stereotypes and doesn’t challenge men to be more socially aware or women to be more aggressive.

On a completely unrelated note, I've discovered a potential fave blogger today: [Ain't No Mom Jeans][no mom link]. I like her style: fun, effortless, and comfortable. And she's rockin' her pixie cut! I've stumbled across two of her posts in the past because she did comparison posts on two of the brands I was interested in [James Perse][jp compare link] and [Everlane][everlane compare link] (And I was interested in James Perse because Grechen's is all [ga-ga][ga ga link] over him; you see how blogging works? It goes full circle.)

Anyway, that's it for now. In the span of writing this post, I have learned how to:

1. create an inline link in markdown
2. delete to the end of sentence in vim (d$)
3. jump backward one sentence (()
4. move backward one word (b)

The power of learning on the fly.
