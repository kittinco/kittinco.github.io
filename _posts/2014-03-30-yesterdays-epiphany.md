For a week or two now, I've been obsessed with this concept of travelling around the world and freelancing full time, and I sort of married that idea. So I would spend 5 hours or so per weekend day just obsessing over resources on RTW travelling and freelancing and other web jobs, and then I run out of steam and realize that I've accomplished nothing during that span of time. Because that's what I do. I try to go from 0 to 100 in one leap. I'm silly. 

Also, when I do research, I tend to do it to be "inspired," rather than to get any concrete data, which amounts to massive amount of frustration and wasted time and effort[^1]. During this burn out phase though, I stumbled upon one paragraph, and that was sort of the epiphany. 

[^1]: I really suck at research papers. 



> The **Pilot** is a personal item carry-on sized travel bag designed to fit the items you want close at hand and easily accessible during your flight or at the airport.[...]Ultralight travelers may choose to use the Pilot as their "one bag" travel bag, utilizing the Pilot's Packing Cubes for organizing clothing and a 3D Clear Organizer Cube for toiletries. - src from [Tom Bihn](http://www.tombihn.com/blog/introducing-pilot)

And that sort of broke it down for me. Because I realized that I can just start off with simple trips that require no more than, say, this [Pilot](http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/pilot.html) bag. Baby steps. Maybe plan a trip 2-3 hrs away for maybe 2-3 days. 

So that was my epiphany of the day. 
Yeah... my muse sucks.

The End. Off to Chipotle for lunch now. 


[^2]: this bag was actually the one that got me started on Tom Bihn because it was awarded the ["Best Carry On"](http://www.carryology.com/projects/carry-awards/the-second-annual-carry-awards-roundup/) bag. 
[^3]: initially I figured that this GoRuck bag would be my ultimum travel bag. I'm a sucker for things marketed as "indestructible" or "becomes better the more you use it." If I were to choose from here, I would've gone for the SD25 for $70. That's my kinda price range. 
[^4]: Because I was obsessed with Emacs this weekend. 
[^5]: ...Because I wanted to use Org-mode.
[^6]: ...Because I wanted to use it for GTD. Because I never GTD. 
[^7]: Beccause I would love to go to Sweden one day. 
[^8]: i'm trying to decide whether to buy this [Sam Edelman Petty boots](http://www.zappos.com/sam-edelman-petty) or not. I like everything about it. sans the bright silver zipper.
